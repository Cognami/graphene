Drill down structure


Real life use case:

User searches by name "Bob Smith" which is node 341.

Node 341 is an attribute of 52 different customer numbers

At some point you want to have the user dive deeper via some unique identifiers.

One solution is to show pre-rasterized images of the graph for each customer, in an infinite scroll pane (like Pintrest/eBay)

Another solution is to show the 52 customer numbers along with other identifiers for those 52.


i.e.

Bob Smith, 123 Broadway St
Bob Smith, 345 Park Ave
Robbie Smith, S/O Dan Smith, 123 Broadway St, Apt 234



Once one or more customer numbers is selected, a graph for those nodes can be constructed.



A third solution would be to calculate for each of those 52, groups of customer ids that have other paths to each other.  This is pretty advanced (and costly) so it's probably better to do this on a case by case basis.
Also precomputing this appears to be an O(n*n!) problem at max depth.  In the worst case, there would be no additional disambiguation.
