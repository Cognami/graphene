Imputing missing values

Data can be categorical or quantitative (scale or continuous).  We can estimate statistics and impute missing data only for the quantitative vars.

User-Missing vs System Missing
Use User-Missing for data we want to treat as missing, use System Missing if the data was actually not provided.
