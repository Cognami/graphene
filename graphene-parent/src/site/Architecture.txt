Neo4j 2.0


To install Microsoft SQL driver into your local repo, do this after you've downloaded the jar file:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=sqljdbc4.jar -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.microsoft.sqlserver -DartifactId=sqljdbc4 -Dversion=4.0

To consider:

neo4j vs hypergraphdb
	using hgdb we still are doing manual graph traversals and bundling to get the right view
	the hypergraphs get flattened to normal graphs in order to view, since visualizing hypergraphs is non trivial (venn diagrams)
	
	neo4j can also run embedded
	neo4j has a very powerful query language built in (cypher)
	
	
	
Maven Module usage
The core application uses a technical oriented module layout (model,dao, rest, ingest, etc)
The customer modules use a business orient layout (customer1, customer2, etc)
The customer submodules are split between ingest and web.  This is only to keep ingest specific code from being housed on a servlet container.
