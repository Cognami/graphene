Case Sensitivity in MSSQL

This can be an issue which causes non deterministic results between the same sets of data on separate database instances.

Collation can be set at various levels:

Server
Database
Column
So you could have a Case Sensitive Column in a Case Insensitive database. I have not yet come across a situation where a business case could be made for case senstivity of a single column of data, but I suppose there could be.

Check Server Collation

SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('COLLATION')
Check Database Collation

SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX('AdventureWorks', 'Collation') SQLCollation;
Check Column Collation

select table_name, column_name, collation_name
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = @table_name


Sometimes the database must be rebuilt during an upgrade, and this may change case sensitivity settings.
