A quick list of comments from a customer.

geospatial was done manually--we should automate this as much as possible.

They commonly use print outs of large anb charts in their daily work (poster size)

reports (pdf generation) is important.  They should also include provenance of each
 piece of data (for suopenas) as well as any search queries used to get to the data.
   (I think we should also include a description of any algorithms used for 
   scoring/weighting, and all of this should be included as part of an appendix to
    keep it from cluttering up the report.) 

graphically represent call activity (weighted edges, histograms, etc)
