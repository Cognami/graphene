Error in xml file:  "content is not allowed in prolog"
Seen in xml files once used by Bericos Snagl (sample files)
For some reason line 644 of import_sample.xml referred to a 
png image that was being decoded as Chinese in UTF-16. Has since been fixed.

To speed up eclipse:

Give it more memory in your eclipse.ini.

Add -Xverify:none to your eclipse.ini.

Dan's Keybindings

Here are keybindings that I use every day:
CTRL+SHIFT+F formats your code to a standard style (indentions, bracket placement, line wrapping, comments etc)
ALT+SHIFT+S -> Sort Members will sort your fields and methods alphabetically, making them much easier to read.
F3 on any class name to go to the class (as long as the source code is available)
F4 on any class name to show the hierarchy of that class

CTRL+SHIFT+G on any class name to find all references
ALT+SHIFT+R to refactor a field or class's name, and change it throughout the source code (note will not affect closed projects/modules!!  So be sure to open all of them.)
CTRL + left click on a @link in comments to go to the class

Dan's Eclipse UI Tips

Double clicking on a tab will full screen it, as best it can.

If you're using multiple monitors you can use Window->New Window 
or just drag a tab to another screen
