Sometimes maven clean fails.. a lot.  Especially if the package it's trying to delete has many files in it.
1: it may be the IDE trying to rebuild files in that directory while maven on the command line is running
or
2: it may be the Windows Search service is on and is holding on to file handles, preventing the clean from completing.

You can try running mvn clean from your IDE, which should help (you may need to cancel any outstanding rebuilds)
A last resort is to try:
mvn clean -Dmaven.clean.failOnError=false && mvn clean -Dmaven.clean.failOnError=false
