/**
 *This package is for view model objects of things which are considered events.  These may be specific to the type of opensource data used during development, and should eventually be replaced by the more generic model named Event.
 *
 * Event: "The fundamental entity of observed physical reality represented by a point designated by three coordinates of place and one of time in the space-time continuum postulated by the theory of relativity"
 * In our case an Event usually includes a payload of some kind of related data.
