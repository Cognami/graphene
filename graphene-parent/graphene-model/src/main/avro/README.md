# Service Provider Interfaces
Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs) provide a plugin style framework for developers to provide 
runtime-injected modules for search, data access, clustering and other services. 
[Avro](http://avro.apache.org/) IDL files in this directory are used to define the SPI protocols in 
language independent form.
The following is a log of changes to the avro service provider interfaces (SPIs) made with each version.
