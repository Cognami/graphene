Graphene's graphene-web module provides several components and pages that make up the base application.

Template files end in .tml and need to exist on the classpath once built into a war (this means they can go under src/main/java/a/b/c or under src/main/resouces/a/b/c, where a/b/c represents the package name of the corresponding Java class that goes with the page or component.)

When referencing graphene-web's components and pages, we use a prefix of the component library namespace, currently "graphene".

You may notice that a component is referenced in a tml file using two different syntax, but both are equivalent:

1) <div t:type="graphene/componentname"> </div>

2) <t:graphene.componentname />

The only difference is that the first one may look better if you open the template in an html editor. (This is referred to as invisible instrumentation)
Both will replace the contents of the tag with the contents of the component.
Furthermore, the contents of anything between the start and end tag are usually discarded, except for layout type components, which wrap the contents.
Note that in the second example, we replace any "/" with "."
Nothing here is case sensitive.

Because we provided the tapestry components as a component library with a namespace, graphene-web does not function as a self running war file, as far as Tapestry components and pages are concerned.
