										<h1>Intro to Workspaces</h1>
										<p>A workspace is a lightweight case management feature for recording the work you do automatically.</p>
										<p>When you first register your account, a workspace will be created for you.</p>
										<p>You may create additional workspaces from the Settings -> Manage Workspaces page</p>
										<p>When you first log in, the most recently updated workspace will be selected for you. You may choose a
											different workspace from the Home page. The currently selected workspace title will be shown at the top of
											the page. Clicking on this title will bring you to the view workspace page.</p>
									</td>
									<td class="info">Tip: Make sure the searches you are performing are relevant for the current workspace you
										have selected.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										<h1>Using a workspace</h1>
										<p>Whenever workspaces are enabled your personal querying and report viewing events will be logged to that
											workspace. By going to the View Workspace page or clicking on the title at the top of the page, you can see a
											list of reports you have saved and the queries you have run.</p>
<p>In the report view, clicking the 'Add To Workspace' button will add that report to a list of saved reports in your <i>current</i> workspace</p>
										<p>Once you find a result you would like to see, click an option from the report actions cell of the
											result you are interested in.</p>
									</td>
									<td class="info">Tip: The queries you have run can be relaunched again!</td>

									<td>
										<h1>Other notes about workspaces</h1>
										<p>The list of query terms is initially sorted by the most recent query.  </p>
										<p>The list of queries will allow for duplicates, so the path of queries in the order they were made.</p>
									</td>
									<td class="info">Tip: Queries that were non-productive or made in error can be removed from the list, however ALL queries are logged for security auditing.</td>
