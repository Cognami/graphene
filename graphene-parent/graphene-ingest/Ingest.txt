Scanner for parts of data to be done during ingest.

Example, find communication ids
We'd need a communication id pattern to apply to some kind of data (probably a string)
We'd have a function to call when the pattern matched (The function may clean the data, or create nodes in a graph, etc)
We'd need the data to be accessible through a stream or iterable interface. (ie. something.next())

The entire process needs to be pluggable as part of a script (probably ordered)
For instance:
findCommunicationIds()
findAddresses()
findFamilialRelations()
findCustomerIds()
findCars()
etc
